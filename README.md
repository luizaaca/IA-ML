# IA-ML

This repository contains materials and notebooks related to fundamental concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

## Main Files

- **Confusion_Matrix.ipynb**: Notebook that explores the concept of the confusion matrix, an important tool for evaluating the performance of machine learning classifiers. The file provides practical examples on how to calculate, visualize, and interpret the confusion matrix.

- **Redução de dimensionalidade.ipynb**: Notebook focused on dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis). These techniques are useful for simplifying datasets, removing redundancies, and improving the performance of machine learning models.

- **LICENSE**: Project license file.

## Purpose

The notebooks are provided for studying and experimenting with different AI/ML concepts, making practical understanding easier through examples and visualizations in Python.

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute!
